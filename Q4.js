/* Comma Operator  mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand.
 A comma operator is used as a separator for multiple expressions at a place that requires a single expression.
  When a comma operator is placed in an expression, it executes each expression and returns the rightmost expression.*/

  //Example:
  for (let a = 0, b =6; a <= 6; a++, b--) { 
    console.log(a, b); 
}
